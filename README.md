## Project Overview

This project investigates the use of artificial intelligence and pose-estimation techniques to automatically recognise gym exercises using a mobile device’s camera.
The system aims to identify the exercise being performed and provide users with supporting information, such as exercise name, instructions, and technique guidance.
It also aims to allow users to log sets, repetitions, and weights in a streamlined way.

The project includes research, design, implementation, and evaluation activities, following an evidence-based and ethically responsible development approach.
