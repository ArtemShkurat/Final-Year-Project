# AI-Powered Gym Assistant
### Final Year Project - BSc Software Engineering (2025/2026)

**Author:** Artem Shkurat (SHK226612576)


## About The Project

This project investigates the use of artificial intelligence and human pose-estimation techniques to automatically recognise gym exercises using a mobile device’s camera. The system aims to identify the exercise being performed and provide users with relevant information, such as the exercise name, targeted muscles, and technique guidelines.

The project also includes features for logging workout data, such as sets, repetitions, and weights, to help users track their training progress efficiently.

Development follows an evidence-based, ethical, and user-focused approach and includes research, design, implementation, risk analysis, and evaluation planning.


## Project Objectives
1. Develop an AI-powered model capable of recognising common gym exercises from pose-estimation data.
2. Explore suitable datasets and training methods to support accurate and generalisable recognition.
3. Design and develop a prototype mobile interface for displaying exercise information and enabling workout tracking.
4. Evaluate the performance, usability, and reliability of the proposed system.
5. Investigate legal, ethical, social, and professional considerations relevant to AI-based motion analysis.

For more examples, please refer to the `Documentation`.
