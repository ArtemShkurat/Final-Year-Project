## About The Project

This project investigates the use of artificial intelligence and pose-estimation techniques to automatically recognise gym exercises using a mobile device’s camera.
The system aims to identify the exercise being performed and provide users with supporting information, such as exercise name, instructions, and technique guidance.
It also aims to allow users to log sets, repetitions, and weights in a streamlined way.

The project includes research, design, implementation, and evaluation activities, following an evidence-based and ethically responsible development approach.

### Project Objectives
1. Develop an AI-powered model capable of recognising common gym exercises from pose-estimation data.
2. Explore suitable datasets and training methods to support accurate and generalisable recognition.
3. Design and develop a prototype mobile interface for displaying exercise information and enabling workout tracking.
4. Evaluate the performance, usability, and reliability of the proposed system.
5. Investigate legal, ethical, social, and professional considerations relevant to AI-based motion analysis.
6. For more examples, please refer to the `Documentation`
